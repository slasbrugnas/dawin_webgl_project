# THREE.JS Project - Simon Lasbrugnas

The goal of this project is to display the equivalent of a small planet (a sphere basically) with a drivable car that goes around it.
Everything in a flat 3D design (maybe)

---

List of things to implement:
* An empty scene
* The sphere
* loading the car
* managing user input (probably arrow keys)
* find a way to get the car to rotate around the sphere ??
* add a on / off button on an overlay to disable the main light source so we can see the car's headlights

Run the project:
```
npm install
npx http-server
```
