# THREE.JS Project - Simon Lasbrugnas

The goal of this project is to display the equivalent of a small planet (a sphere basically) with a drivable car that goes around it.
Everything in a flat 3D design (maybe)

---

List of things to implement:

- <s>An empty scene</s>
- <s>The sphere</s>
- <s>loading the car</s>
- managing user input (probably arrow keys)
- find a way to get the car to rotate around the sphere ??
- add a on / off button on an overlay to disable the main light source so we can see the car's headlights

Run the project:

```
npm install
npx http-server
```
